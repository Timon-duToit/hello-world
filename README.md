# hello-world
This is just my trial as a new developer learning the ropes.
I am a masters student in archaeology that is learning about making video games, so that I can make interacting with heritage more enjoyable and interesting for everybody. But that's just my 'work' life. Generally speaking, I am an avid fan of myths and folklore, cultural pursuits like music and art, I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy, and I enjoy exercise and the outdoors (maybe camping, but only if there's wifi;p).
